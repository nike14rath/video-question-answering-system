VS Code is a source code editor If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system Then you can download this for that operating system And the process is exactly the same as you can see As you can see, in my Downloads folder Here, the VS Code has been downloaded And as you can see here, this setup has been downloaded I will refresh it And here, you can see the setup of the VS Code I can double click on it and install it So simply, installing VS Code is as easy as installing a game You can quickly read the agreement here This lies in upslice to... Damages And after this, I will accept the agreement You also read it like me And I am the fastest reader in the world Next, next Here, it is important to check both the icons It is very important to check both the icons If you want a desktop shortcut If you want to get a shortcut in the desktop Click on the Create a Desktop icon And then click on Next Then click on Install If your PC is as fast as mine, then it will be as fast as mine But if your PC is slow, then it is not a problem It will be a slow install Nothing more than this Now, here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel Because I want you to follow these videos exactly Like I will put a video and you get a notification So if you want to follow this course completely Ideally, you should subscribe With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded I have opened my VS Code Don't be afraid of this, beginners And I am saying this again If you already know these things We are taking a beginner friendly start in the initial videos But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos So stay tuned I would also like to request you to tell me in the comment section What is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section How far do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate Please do comment Now, let's understand why we have downloaded this VS Code So if you don't know what a beginner app is Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor Which helps you in editing your code Now, you might think that I can edit my code in a notepad So yes, you can edit it in a notepad I am not saying this sarcastically But it can be done in a notepad Let's set it up and see what is there Which makes it different from a notepad Let's set it up quickly I won't browse color themes Infact, I will do it I will put my dark modern theme I have done all this Next section You can also close this welcome But again, here are some tips for you That's it Here, your VS Code has started This is the VS Code screen You can create a new file or folder But I will recommend you to close it Yes, close it Why have you closed it? I am going to create a new folder And I am going to name it Sigma Web Development Course And we will do everything in this course We will do everything We will do everything related to the course You can right click on shift If you are in Windows You can see an option called open with code This open with code option helps you to open this particular folder in VS Code You can select it Now, you can say yes, I trust this file Click on it and say yes, I trust the authors And this folder is open If I click on plus to create a new file Suppose I have written index.html Write it down if you don't know what I am writing Enter it And then I will write Hey, I am your first HTML file Suppose I have written this You can see this dot, it's white The reason is that you haven't saved this file Please save it If you hit control S, it will be saved I will recommend you to go to the file And enable the auto save option As you type, you won't see this dot Your file will be saved instantly And I recommend this We won't use control S Otherwise, if you want to save it with control S You can disable this option One more thing I would like you to do Click on gear, then on settings And search for mouse Mouse mouse You can see here editor, mouse wheel zoom You can check it I will tell you what happens if you check it Just check it and close settings You don't have to worry about VS code How it is What is this, what is this You don't have to check all these You can simply scroll it And your font size changes Now I will show you a magic It's very simple In downloads, in sigma web development course What happened in folder This file is made index.html Which is very natural Because I have opened this folder in VS code Because I have opened this folder in VS code This file is also made here I will make another file here I will make a file named this.txt And I will write this is this So this file will be made here So this folder and this VS code Are running in sync I can open it from here And I will show you That my file is opened in notepad So I can do that too But I won't use notepad Because there are some things in VS code Which notepad doesn't give me And I want to get those features I don't want to overrun you But I will show you What is in VS code Which you don't get in notepad If I write here, say HTML If I type enter And I type in the location mark It gives me a boilerplate of HTML If I click on it, you can see The basic code of HTML is here We will talk about this later Don't get overwhelmed by this But I want to tell you How this VS code is useful Why we didn't use notepad And why we used VS code And we get this feel Like developer, hacker That feel is also important That's why we get confidence to do coding I want to comment on Things which are similar to you I am using windows I can't use 3 laptops Linux, mac and windows 3 I can't use them together So things will be exactly same for you In fact, I want to say Things will be very similar So you can follow along Very easily Don't get tensed I will tell you about some extensions And you will enjoy using them I really enjoyed But I will tell you in a while And this is criminally underrated I am telling you that you will enjoy I want to tell you before that If you right click on command And click on command palette You will get many options of VS code You don't need to know all these options As we will move forward in the course All the features which will be used I will tell you about them And you can use them But what I will do now I will toggle a screencast mode You don't have to do this But I will do it You will get to know I will type anything If I press caps lock You will get to know when I pressed which button This is not irrelevant for you But I want to tell you That screencast mode We can change Its settings from here Now you can see The vertical offset of screencast mode Vertical offset means If I make vertical offset 0 It will come up If I make vertical offset 70 It will come down I will make it 60 If I make it 80 It will come up From bottom it will come up So I made it 0 Now I will type anything You will see it down Which is ideal So I will close this .txt file These are tabs You have tabs in chrome These are exactly the same I hope you got to know what these are You will forget about what we have written I will tell you step by step What exactly is it You can also close the welcome page By any chance if you want to zoom in Which I will do Because I am recording video Add Ctrl plus numpad plus I am zooming in because I am recording videos I will tell you that you can see the screen from close But when I am coding I don't zoom in that much So these are related to VS code I want to tell you How websites work A website basically Works with 3 types of people Imagine 3 people One is client brother One is server brother One is client brother Second is server brother Third is browser brother So what is browser brother So browser brother, client brother, server brother What is client, what is server, what is browser I am client You, us all Who use a browser Who is browser? This is chrome Hello Chrome, I am client When I write codewithhari.com Suppose I write codewithhari.com So basically what I say I say from this browser Please give me codewithhari.com website Please give me codewithhari.com website Or if I write youtube.com I say Give me youtube.com website I say browser brother Give me youtube.com I want to see youtube Browser says you want youtube Take this, ok So here I will enter youtube.com So from server He brought youtube.com You all understand From server He brought youtube.com and he parsed This screen This work happened so fast Because my internet.com Internet speed is very fast Even this is less, people have more But still according to my locality It is very fast So with this fast internet speed All these things are getting very fast So client sends a request to server Through browser, browser is client Means my assistant Whatever I say to the browser, he will do it He will help me to bring this web page from server Who is managing the server? Server is managing youtube They are managing youtube.com server And inside that server There is some code written Which sends me this type of code Means when I write youtube.com This code came Now how to convert this code into this This is browser's work So client says Give me youtube.com Browser says you want youtube.com Wait, I will ask youtube.com Then browser goes to server Means it requests server It asks server to give me youtube.com Server will either give it Or will say no Or will say error Or will say server error Whatever response is there Ideally 200 should be there With that response Our browser Comes back to client And shows this type of page I hope this is clear to you So client goes to browser Browser to server And again to client This is important When you write google.com Client asks browser to give me google.com Browser says Gurudev, you want google.com Wait, I will get it from server Server goes to browser And gives you google.com And you get google.com Now along with google.com Server sends all images Videos, icons All these icons URL of these icons is written in this code And that too Browsers work to display it properly So server sends a bundle to browser Like this And passing this bundle And showing it like this Now further whatever interaction User will make additional request With this page If I right click and inspect And go to network I wrote Harry So many requests For images So as you interact You will have to send more requests To browser So consider this as a restaurant You gave order As you gave order Waiter took your order And sent it to your kitchen You consider kitchen as server And when kitchen gave order Back Waiter Which is working as browser That waiter saw you And gave order It may not be possible to make an order in kitchen It is rare that you don't get an order But it happens Here also you get to see errors 404 error or 500 error Server is not working So whenever you see such errors You get to know But ideally 200 Means OK response So you get such web page So you can consider it as restaurant So whenever you write google.com slash mail So google.com slash mail is available And if you write code with Harry.com slash contact So code with Harry.com slash contact Is available then it will show you If not available then 404 will show Or 500 error So whatever server will send will show you So this cycle is going on Client sent request Browser sent server Server processed request So server sent data back to browser And whatever data it sent Browser showed it to client Then client did something Browser sent same request to server Server sent something Whatever data server sent came back to client And so on So now you will say that this is fine But what is back end Back end is how server is processing request Now if you have a blog Blog has a lot of data So what you will do You will store every blog's web page separately Or you will generate that content dynamically Or you will generate that content dynamically Or you will generate that content dynamically I'll take google example If I search Harry by here So you can see google header These links This format doesn't change If I write here Suppose Shubham So I'll write Shubham Now see when I wrote Harry by Google is showing me similar content So what google does Google's server Back end processes data In such a way that It can send this kind of HTML query So when I write Shubham It sends this When I write Harry by It sends this So the process of generating this Is happening through same back end Now this back end can be Django This back end can be Flask This back end can be Node.js This back end can be Ruby on Rails And the database used in back end Is used So the back end code is not visible to client This is front end code which is sent by server And how server made this code We don't know Because this code is running on server If you are confused then don't be You'll understand everything Now we'll see back end Now we'll see how front end works Now front end is primarily made With 3 languages JavaScript and HTML These 3 languages are needed If you are making a website So every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript In most of the cases If you use HTML only Then it becomes very basic After that when you use CSS You can style it Like this button looks like this So it's only because of CSS Along with that this button is seen as red Or this button looks like this This is all done with CSS So you can see the edges here This is all done with CSS So CSS is used to style a page Which button What color will be What will be done by hover All these things are done with CSS So CSS is beauty of HTML HTML is the existence Body of any page This is a standard which is agreed If you make any website then it will be made in HTML So that browser makers can understand How to parse How to parse HTML And HTML is a skeleton This is a standard Anyone who makes a website in this world Will make it in HTML This is a standard This is a standard made so that Everyone can make the same kind of pages And if someone is making a browser Then they have to parse the same language If as a beginner you have learnt 80% HTML Then you are good to go for web development Now some things happen directly from HTML Like if I show you a quick HTML code So I am writing something like this HTML code I have used the exclamation mark And used the Emmet abbreviation Don't worry about how I have written this code I will write this is HTML And I can open this HTML file Directly like this And as soon as I open this HTML file Directly like this You can see it will open like this I can open it directly By double clicking And it opened This is not a simple HTML code This HTML file is very basic Now you can run videos directly from HTML I have an HTML file Which I will show you I will change this HTML file And show you Such that we can show videos So HTML has a video tag If we enter a video Then the video that we will put in SRC will play Like if I put video 1.mp4 You can see the VS code has shown automatically So I will reload this video So you can see This video has shown automatically I can play it To play I have to write controls And I will refresh it So I will have the controls to play This is a very expensive And a very expensive product It needs a lot of money It needs cash It is asking for 130 crores Now if I put video 2.mp4 I have put video 1 I have put video 1 I have 2 more videos I have some more videos If I put it here And after that I will refer to them If I put video 2.mp4 instead Then you can see video 2 I will reload it This is Ben Stokes lookalike Which I have put in the video And I will show it to people What it looks like This is Ben Stokes lookalike If I put video 3 Then I will reload it And you can see I can play it This is our third video I have put video 3.mp4 I will close it And we can also play video 4 And video 4 is a DJ video Which has a DJ playing So you can see This is a DJ video So you can see This is a DJ video This is a DJ video This is a DJ video So you can make such things By using only HTML You don't need to do anything else You can play videos with HTML You can display images You can do all this with HTML If you want to style it For example, I want to have a border Or a red background Then what I have to do for that I have to use CSS for that CSS adds beauty On any website Then comes JavaScript Which adds interaction On any website For example, what will happen when I click on search What will happen when I write Code with harry Like I wrote code with harry and here There are many things like autocomplete Why did this happen? Because a request went on the server And for this query The autocomplete results came So all these things are done with JavaScript This is called client-side scripting So if we want to do Coding on client-side Then we can do it With JavaScript This is also called brain So our website becomes beauty with brain I am talking about website Beauty with brain CSS adds beauty And brain comes from JavaScript JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic Like if you want to change the content Without loading the page Then all this is done with JavaScript Here are many mosquitoes They are not getting anything from here My racket is working Oh my god Like the video because I eat current snacks for you So when I was in college Someone told me that I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript one by one First learn 100% HTML Then learn 100% CSS Until you remember all the properties Then learn JavaScript But this is a wrong idea Why is it wrong? Because you only have 80% HTML And you only have 40-60% CSS And JavaScript So you can learn 50-70% And start web development And make projects And you can move forward In this course I will tell you about chat GPT and web development And what is the impact of chat GPT So we will discuss about this So don't ever run after perfection About HTML and CSS Don't think that you will do HTML for one year Then CSS for next year Then JavaScript for the third year Then make projects in the fourth year Then you will have 80% HTML, CSS 40-60% CSS And you will learn JavaScript 50-70% And you can make a great website And as you make the website Your experience will teach you more HTML More CSS and JavaScript And you will not even know that you have perfected HTML, CSS, JavaScript While you are making money And working as a professional web developer So you will be earning along with learning And also Moving your skills forward So don't ever think that you will make a website Only when you remember all HTML tags Only when you remember all CSS properties Only when you remember all JavaScript I will teach you this much That matters We are going to learn what matters And I don't want you to learn for years That's why I have designed this course So that you can learn only what matters And you can learn the rest of the things And I am going to teach you a lot of things in this course Here we have some mosquitoes To learn sigma web development And our audience is increasing In this course we will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript And I will teach you some tricks That you might have never heard before And I have learned some tricks In my career I will tell you in this course I have learned some amazing tricks In my career very late And I want you to learn them While starting the course If you have any doubt in this course You can use the hashtag doubt And ask your doubt I am going to try to answer all the doubts I will try I will try my best to solve your doubts So if you have any question You can use the hashtag doubt Please don't use the hashtag doubt In your questions Or in your comments Write without using the hashtag doubt So that I can prioritize the comments With the hashtag doubt I will try to answer all the doubts As much as I can And you will learn everything in this course If you haven't done it yet That will bring a smile on my face Now what is React, Next.js What is Angular So all these front-end frameworks Help you to use JavaScript HTML, CSS, JavaScript Is the only way to create a website And helps you to make this process faster How? We will learn this in this course Yes, we will learn in this course I told you that I will make this course In a different way I will make you from zero to Hero in the next course You can tie your chair Because you have won the ticket of Sigma Web Development Express I want to give you a good analogy To teach HTML, CSS and JavaScript HTML is just like a car skeleton If you paint it, it's CSS And if you put it in an internal engine It's JavaScript For example, a skeleton is HTML If you put it in a skin, it's CSS And if you put it in a brain It's JavaScript Now I will take you to Forbes.com As soon as you go to Forbes You will see a website And Forbes.com Is a website that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript Just like any other website If I right click here And click on inspect Then this inspect element is opened Now here you can see They have used the script in the head And here to add CSS They have used the link So I will remove their CSS From here To remove CSS I will simply clear All their style tags Using the delete key As soon as I remove all these style tags And all the link tags As soon as I delete all their styles Look at the condition of this page This page looks like this It only has raw HTML What should be the size of the images All this is forgotten HTML is written here Which has not been styled at all So Forbes.com is like this Without CSS It only shows raw buttons Raw text Raw links And similarly, I can see Without JavaScript How this website will look Now if I delete the HTML tag Like this I have deleted all the head So this is a blank page So this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript In making a web page I want to tell you This course was initially made to be paid But I changed my mood and converted it Into a free course And I thought I will upload it on YouTube So I want you to be serious Many people reached out to me To launch a paid course But I felt that this course should be kept free Because when I was learning web development I can understand When you don't have a course to learn And you don't have the affordability So I decided to launch this course Which is absolutely free This course is free But according to this free plan As soon as you earn crores You will give me tea, coffee, parties And all the gifts This is our agreement in this video So when you start earning crores Or lakhs, then just send me a green leaf Or maybe a red leaf But you have to do this only when you start earning good Only after you start earning good In the next video I will tell you how you can earn money After completing this course I will put a light on this That this is also important How to earn money How I do freelancing How clients come I will tell you everything in this course I want to tell you some action items The first action item is to access the playlist Which I will give you in the description Everyone bookmark the playlist Press the star button here And then press the star button and bookmark And save button is in the playlist Many of you said that the course is paid And we will buy it Thank you so much for all the support And whatever you show me love and trust It encourages me But this course is going to be free Now there should be no technical issues I am putting all these videos in the resolution above 1080p So you should see it clearly But many people say That the video is in SD 240p, 144p We watch Bali's wedding We finish the internet of Jio And watch Bali's wedding from morning to evening And then you tell me that this video is not HD Someone call Nagar Palika So I hope you understood the request And response in this video How all these websites work We got a basic idea How client-server interaction happens In the coming videos We will see how the website is made We are going to make our first website in the next video So you should be very excited Because in the next video Our first website is going to be made And it is possible that some of you Will have that first website So access the playlist Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time Thank you"
