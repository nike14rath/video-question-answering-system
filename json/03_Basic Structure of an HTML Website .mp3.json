have given so much love to this course Like this course with high energy Because for this Sigma free course, Sigma chats are the best choice In today's video, I'll explain the basic structure of a website Along with that, I'll tell you guys a mobile trick With which you guys will know how to preview your websites on your phone I have a request from you guys, write it in the comment section And tell me if you know HTML That will help me structure this course better In this video, I'll tell you guys the impact of ChatGPD Because there are a lot of talks going on about ChatGPD In the upcoming videos, I'll be giving you guys quizzes So understand this video very carefully And learn all the concepts Let's go to the computer screen Let's roll the intro So guys, I've come inside my computer screen Now, we'll talk about how to open, close, and structure a website So in this folder, I'll create a folder called Video3 Click on New, then Video3 And in the folder, right click on the shift and open with code And you can see here that my theme is blue And a lot of people have said that blue theme is not good But the theme is our choice If you want to change your theme, you can change your theme If you want to use GitHub's dark theme, you can use GitHub's dark theme It's your choice To create a new file, I'll add index.html We've already talked about this If I write the title of the page And here I write the content And here I can use the link tag And here I can use Emmet And I can link style.css I'm doing this so fast because we've already talked about this in the previous video And here if I write script.js And here I write alert hello So I won't tell you again and again That if I add a script tag here Before the body And after that I add a script.js And here I open with browser And here if I write the background of the body in red, it'll be red I won't tell you all this because I've already told you all this I'll tell you now That what does this structure mean Why did I write it so big I'll tell a beginner that why can't we write the title and the content directly What is the need to write so much So I'll tell you what is the need to write so much I'll reload it and see the content here It's here and it's red here Now you've seen that I needed to reload the page You must be wondering why I needed to reload When it already reloads live So I changed the CSS file When I change the CSS file I need to reload it at times If you're using HTML file You don't need to reload the HTML file changes like this Now here I'll come back and explain it to you This is a basic structure of any HTML website First we write doc type HTML Then we write HTML tag Now see this is the opening tag of HTML tag This is the closing tag This is the opening tag of the body This is the closing tag This is the opening tag of the head This is the closing tag Meaning that whatever is inside it is the content of the head Whatever is inside HTML is the content of HTML Accordingly, whatever is inside the title is the content of the title Now you'll ask what is the content of the meta So meta is a self-closing tag There are two types of tags in HTML One is self-closing tag and the other is pair tag What happens in pair tag is that Your opening tag is a closing tag So this is the basic structure of HTML website Now here you've seen that the background is red What is the reason behind this background red This is happening because of CSS If I remove CSS from here and ask CSS to move it quickly What will I say to CSS Move it quickly And as soon as I ask CSS to move it quickly It will have to move from here I'll reload the page So you can see that it has moved Similarly, I can also say from JavaScript Move it quickly If I say from here, the alert will also stop So if I reload now, the alert will also stop So in this HTML content I've added CSS and JavaScript Additionally, we've used CSS and JavaScript Functionalities to link it with this HTML page Now I've already told you about title tag It is used to set the title of the page Now you have to understand that You can see the title above Search engines also use it Google search engines like Code with Harry HTML So I've added all the titles of Code with Harry HTML introduction, HTML working On the page You can see HTML introduction This is the title of the page So these titles are used by search engines And are parsed Now if I change the page Then the title of HTML working Now I'll change the page again Now you can see the title of HTML installation So the titles keep changing Along with that, as I keep changing It will keep changing As you can see So the title of HTML pages It doesn't mean that you can see it above These are also very useful in SEO And it tells you what is the content inside the page So it describes the content of the page So here I can see the content of HTML So HTML execution means How the page is executed So changing the title of the page Is a very good SEO practice So we can change the title of the page From any framework Now in the head section There is the metadata of the page Like the title And the script you want to link Along with that, there are other meta tags Which I'll tell you about later Meta tags basically mean How is the HTML document? It tells you about it Keywords are added, descriptions are added Meta description is a very important keyword For SEO So you can write about this page If you go to my website You'll see the meta description tag In the view page source This is compressed HTML So don't get confused But here you can see the meta description tag Which describes this page If we talk about Google So I want to tell you about the doc type HTML, and in the head section There are meta tags, title tags, script tags And link tags So you can add the script tag Before and after the body And what are the differences We'll talk about it in the next course But here you can see I've added the CSS using the link Then the body is the main content Which you can see on this page So what you'll see on this page Is the body So you can see the body here And whatever script you'll add Will be executed Now by adding the script here And the script in the head I'll tell you about it in the next course But this is a basic structure of HTML Lang is equal to EN is an attribute With any tag Lang is equal to EN So Lang is an attribute with value EN So these key value pairs are used Which tell about this tag Like in meta tag So name is equal to description is an attribute And if you hover in VS code It'll tell you about it I've hovered on the name So it's telling about the attribute Why, how, how it's used Now most of the content Of the body You'll mostly copy from HTML raw Mostly from the website codewithdari.com You'll come here and copy the source code If I talk about the forms You'll come here and copy the HTML forms And start making your own forms So copy and paste is very important As a senior developer You should know From where to copy and paste And I'm not saying this sarcastically I'm not saying it sarcastically This thing will always be the same You can type it or copy paste it Obviously you'll prefer to copy paste it Because it's not going to change The form will remain the same And if you copy paste it Then you'll save time Then you'll have to think about innovation That you'll copy paste That thing which has to be copied And where you have to think That can't be copied Then you'll save time and think about it The most important part Of being a senior software developer Is to know where to copy paste from Which stack overflow question to copy paste from And how to paste it from Where copyright code withdari.com 2024, 25, 26 I've already said this But I have a lot of courage in this statement Now I'll tell you about a technique Which will enable you to see This website or whatever we'll develop You'll be able to see in this mobile Now listen to the steps carefully Open terminal and write ipconfig If you are in the old version You can open command prompt or power shell As soon as you type ipconfig You'll see ipv4 address 192.168.1.199 Now this ip address Which we got here I'll copy it And in settings I'll write Live preview This local ip address To host your files on I'll write my ip address After this I'll restart my vscode You'll have to ensure One more thing That you'll go to your wifi settings And do your network in private It shouldn't be public It should be private Network and internet, wifi Whatever wifi you're connected with Do it in private Now you'll do show preview Here you'll see your ip address I can use this on my phone too I'll put this ip address here 192.168.1.199 You can also put 3000 Whatever your port is You can put that And here you'll see My website is previewed on my phone This trick is very useful When we want to preview on our phone Because most of the websites are seen on the phone So we want our phone users To enjoy our website And we're already developing On our computer So that testing will be done I haven't put my review in the first video So I'll request you To review your course in the first video I told you in the last video Please review it You'll put an initial review You can write your initial review And people will know What is the initial review of this course You have to give me 5 messages stars And you have to access this playlist And bookmark it Or you'll click star And it'll show up in your bookmarks So you can bookmark sigma web development course And you can click here and save it Very few people have accessed this playlist So I want everyone to access this playlist Bookmark it and save it So access this playlist Like this video And name your village and your uncle's land as mine Thank you so much for watching this video And I'll see you next time Thank you"}
