paragraphs along with that, I'll also tell you about anchor text If you found this course awesome, then do like this video Your likes will help me in getting such free courses In this video, we'll make a small project which will be a bookmark website This bookmark website will help you in getting all your favorite websites together and you'll be able to use it in actual So let's start quickly Write in the comments below, sigma batch op Let's roll the intro Intro music So guys, as you can see, I'm in my computer screen and if you haven't accessed the playlist yet, then you can do that One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to github.com or repository then you'll get a GitHub repo of sigma web dev course I've made a folder for all the videos and I've made a commit according to the folder So do access this folder so that you can get the source code I'll also put the source code in the description so there's no problem Now we'll make a very basic website but it'll be very important for us because it'll be our first useful website So without taking much time I'll make a new folder in this sigma web dev folder and I'll name it video4 because it's our fourth video So I'll make it with the name video4 by clicking on shift right and open with code After doing this, I'll do the same thing that we always do index.html, main.css, style.css and script.js We usually make these 3 files If I write css, I'll put it here if I write script, I'll put it here but for now, I'll just write an exclamation mark and write in the document my bookmarks So we're going to make a bookmark website and I'll write code with that So you must've seen titles like this Now I'll write h1 here Now what happens with h1? You can add headings to your website with h1 We talked about the basic structure We said that it tells that this is an HTML page html lang is equal to en lang is an attribute and its value is en which means that the content of this page is in English and it tells this to search engines or if anyone is using this webpage link then they'll know that this webpage is in English and they can parse this webpage accordingly browser will also know that your webpage is in English Now here we have a head which contains metadata like the title of the page, css link and all these things are information and the main content is in the body Now to add headings to the body we have a tag called h1 and I'll write my bookmarks here So if I write my bookmarks here then I'll write this with h1 tag and if I want to live it I'll click here and then I'll open it in browser and see how my bookmarks look like and why we should use them why I didn't write my bookmarks directly because I'm telling the browser that this is my heading and this is my first level heading now let's say I want to keep two kinds of bookmarks in my bookmarks one is main bookmarks and one is secondary bookmarks so I'll use h2, which is the heading of the second level so if you use Microsoft word then you'll know what h1 and h2 are but if you don't know then I'll tell you h1 is your main level heading and the other level heading is h2, let's say I say main bookmarks and secondary bookmarks let's say I do something like this and here I'll press alt, shift and down arrow like this I'll do one thing, why not turn on screencast mode so what I did here I pressed alt, shift and down arrow so this is replicated, this is a shortcut of BS code I want to tell you one more shortcut of BS code if you press alt in your keyboard and then wherever you click there will be a cursor let's say I click here then only one cursor will appear but if I press alt if I click somewhere else then there will be a cursor let's say I want to code with every bookmarks so my bookmarks dash code with every something like this how did I do this, I clicked here then I pressed alt and wherever I click there I'll get multiple cursor, then whatever I type will appear in multiple cursor wherever there are cursor whatever I type will appear isn't it fun, like this so I'll remove it like this and you'll see this will be updated so this is my main heading, this is my H2 in the same way from H1 to H2 we have headings up to H6 let's say you gave a main heading after main heading you gave a secondary heading then after that you have to give some heading in it and so on, you have to give many subheadings then you can give heading up to H6 H6 is more than enough in HTML headings are up to 6 you'll never need H7 in practical life if we talk about it and if you keep on reading then you can use H6 repeatedly because it becomes so small after H1 that H6 will become too small so you don't want it to be too small now what I'll do here I'll replicate it with alt shift down arrow and I'll click here I'll press alt I'm telling you all these shortcuts so that your productivity increases now I've put two cursor here and here I'll press backspace and make it H3 then I'll click here, press alt, click here and make it H4, ok and I'll click here, click here and make it H5 then I'll click here then I'll click here and make it H6 so it's up to H6 now what I'll do is write using H1 and I'll write using here I'll press space, write using then H and now I've to do is to write 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and you can see it's looking like this so you know that H1 is like this, H2 is like this H3 is small, H4 is small, H5 is small H6 is small and what will happen if H6 is small? it'll be over in a while so H6 is more than enough so I'll show you a practical demonstration so let's say this is my HTML tutorial so here I've given the main heading, HTML introduction then I've given here what is HTML then I've given features of HTML I've given this from H1, this from H2 then if something came in H2 then I've given this from H3 if something came in it, like here why the term was hypertext and markup language this is heading 2, what's the main heading page? HTML introduction then this is the heading I've to give a quick exercise in this too so I've used H3 in that too then I've come back to H2 so in building the hierarchy H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 are used I hope you've understood many people are commenting that you're starting very slow so I'm making this course as a beginner course when I tell you about HTML then you'll say that it's very easy then I'll tell you about CSL I'll tell you that it's easy then you'll say JavaScript yes, it's easy then I'll say Bootstrap yes, it's easy then React then Node.js then I'll take things from MongoDB to MySQL then one day the level will go up I said we'll raise the bar so when we will do React when I'll make projects there then I'll ask them for their comments and ask them for their level so, this is our headings 6 headings which I'll keep like this now, if we want to write a paragraph, we can use P tag we'll type P and it'll be the paragraph now, let me tell you a shortcut trick if you want to write a dummy paragraph in Emet through VS code you'll write here, say I wrote Lorem 23 here, we have Emet abbreviation it'll give us 23 words you can also use View to write a word rap so, you can use View to write a word rap here, we have Lorem Epsom dollar set we want dummy text because we're making a template and we have to fill that template with something for example, you're making a website which looks like OYO rooms here, we have OYO become a member OYO for business, I don't want to write here I just wrote Lorem I'll write Lorem 7 and enter then I'll give it to OYO and they'll write it you can use it to fill the placeholder my plan is to make clones of popular websites so that you know how things work this is also a popular website now we'll see other things like paragraphs, how to style them these are all done through CSS in paragraphs, when I wrote Lorem 23 I got this much text now I'll press P to enter, if I write Lorem 10 then only 10 words will come, and if I want to write Lorem 100 then I can do that too so, this Lorem trick is very good whenever we make a clone of a popular website let's say I make a clone of Amazon.in here, I have to write something I can't see much text here, let's say I have to write 3 words I'll write Lorem 3, I won't think about makeup products I'll write Lorem 4, Lorem 3, Lorem 2 I'll make a template and then I'll get it from my database and I can get it from different sources many people asked if this course is job ready the answer is yes, this course is job ready I'll make you guys so that you can actually do industry level jobs through this course now let's talk about the attributes in HTML these are the attributes in HTML like I used HTML tag, lang is equal to en, lang is an attribute we didn't use any attribute in body, in h1 we didn't use any attribute in p, but I can use a style attribute in p, which is also called inline CSS inline CSS is also called inline CSS if I make the background color red then the background color of this will be red this is also called inline CSS through style attribute style is equal to if you add CSS we learned to add CSS here, but if you add style is equal to then you'll get this background red let me show you, this is the background red let me use this color, this one looks good I can also add inline CSS, but when you make industry level websites, we use inline CSS less because it reduces maintainability and reusability so we want to shift a small bundle on the browser and our website is more optimized so we avoid all these things, but inline CSS has style tag but here style is an attribute, p is a tag p tag has an attribute style through which we can style this element, we'll also learn about attributes basically give an element enhanced functionality for example, we gave this paragraph a style which was background color thizzle to give this background color, we used style attribute similarly, to give properties we use any tag or element we use these attributes for example, if we talk about link, we talked about link colon CSS, link has relic attribute so with these attributes, we can use this CSS style sheet for example, background color I'll say body first what we need in body is background color and don't worry about it because CSS will tell you all this but let me tell you, let's say I'll do hot pink let's listen to another functionality of VS code this ninja technique will be very useful and here you can choose any color you want I'll leave it here and if I do this, you can see the background color of my body how was it? write in comments, it was very useful now we are back in index.html I can remove it if I want, I'll comment it so it won't be the style sheet, which is very natural background color was coming from style sheet so it's not removed, which is very natural here I did style is equal to background color so it was visible now we are going to make a bookmark manager bookmark manager.html and I'm making this file because I've told you all different headings I'm going to make a useful bookmark manager bookmark manager you might ask why I'm making this bookmark manager it's made by me, it's my child I made it, so you'll have a different love for it because you made this yourself someone made a software, you bought it from somewhere so the software you made yourself is different now you can see here bookmark manager code I'll write H1 and my bookmarks now I'll write H2 primary bookmarks and then H2 for secondary bookmarks in fact if I press ALT SHIFT and space bottom and write secondary bookmarks so what will happen, I can write secondary bookmarks now I'll write google in a paragraph or I'll write google like this, we'll write it from list but in the upcoming videos I'll tell you how to use list for now you can think like this now I'll write open google and I'll use anchor tag so as soon as I type A, it has a mandatory attribute href, which means which link should I go to so I'll write href is equal to https://www.google.com so I'll go to this address whenever I click on open google and I'll cut this open google and put it here so the content of the stack will be like this now it's open google this is called anchor tag which helps us to make links you must have seen many such links now as soon as I go to bookmark manager.html you can see that you can see all the bookmarks now I'll click on it and google will open now you can see, one thing you noticed when I didn't click on it, it was blue now I visited it and its color has changed now I'll tell you one more thing if we want it to open in the new tab like I'm clicking on it it's opening in the same tab if you want to open it in the new tab, you have two options either you can click on the mouse wheel like this now I'll tell you another way if you want to open it in the new tab, you can use an attribute you can write here target is equal to underscore blank and we get suggestions for VS code so I wrote it in two enters if you write it in a cheap editor then you'll have to type target is equal to underscore blank according to the quality it's a pain but if you write it in any way now I'll click on it and it'll open in the new tab I can open it like this I've written a simple open google if you want, you can use your favorite website you can put your favorite website here I've put good websites here now I'll write open facebook and here you can see and here I'll write kora.com and codewithhari.com let's see which website I'll put youtube.com let's see if it's coming or not if you want it to not come in one line then you can put it in your paragraphs it's a very dirty way I'll tell you why I'm calling it dirty way but you can close it in a paragraph and I'll press shift, right arrow, control x then I'll press end, all the cursors will go to end because if you press end on one cursor, it goes to end and I'll control it too I've used this shortcut a lot and some of you will be like what did I do? if you're a beginner but I simply used the functionality of vs code I've used multiple cursors by pressing alt this is not a good idea we never make a list by using paragraphs but this will work it will look like this and the ones we didn't visit are blue we visited facebook, it's color is purple now these are your primary bookmarks let's put 2 secondary bookmarks let's say you visit wikipedia.com and let's say stackoverflow.com we'll write the spelling properly let's capitalise on stackoverflow and now you can see your secondary bookmarks wikipedia and stackoverflow this is your bookmark manager we'll learn more about CSS styling so don't worry if it looks ugly don't worry about it we'll talk about styling and designing for now, your bookmark looks like this and I'll write it in h1 so both our titles will be the same and my bookmarks code will be written here so you can make a bookmark manager like this you can use it in actual let's say you save it like this you can copy it and put it on your desktop and whenever you want to open a website you just double click it and then you'll have to open it with right click and then choose another app and then choose google chrome and always do it so whenever I double click it, it'll open with google chrome so this was our bookmark manager I hope you liked it I have a request for you, today we've completed 4 videos so if you liked this course, share it with your friends I know very few people will share it and I'll try to bring more courses like this many people are shocked and say how can you earn money from this course I'll find some other ways to make more money but the thing is, I'll mark this course as the best with everything I'll put everything in it and teach you I got a lot of attacks from many companies they told me to launch a paid course and they told me to launch it as a paid course why are you doing this, you'll regret your decision but hopefully I won't regret my decision I'll earn money from other ways and I'll teach you how to earn more money with that said, I'll put its source code in the description or you can take it from this repository that's it for this video thank you so much for watching this video I'll see you in the next one"}
