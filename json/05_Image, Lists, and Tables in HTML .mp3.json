    "text": " In this video, we'll see how images are made, lists are made in HTML and tables are made. So, like the video. I know very few people like videos on YouTube. But if you do, thanks to your support, I get the motivation to bring such free courses. So, let's go to the computer screen and start the 5th video of the Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I'm here on my computer screen. As you can see, I want to tell you to bookmark getup.com slash codewithhari. In fact, bookmark this repository so that you get all the code. Secondly, click on the playlist and bookmark it. Click on start and click on save. Now, the first thing I'll tell you about is about images. What is image in HTML? So, what we'll do is we'll make a folder here. Here, you'll find the new folder named video5. And here, video5. You'll know this by clicking on shift right and open with code. This time, I'll speed it up a lot because I've already told you. But if you want to avoid seeing this welcome page again and again, then uncheck show welcome page on startup. And you won't be able to see this again and again. But what we're doing is we'll make index.html, we'll make some control, we'll zoom in by using mouse wheel, we'll toggle the screencast mode so that you'll know when and why I'm pressing which button. Now, I'll put an exclamation mark here and bring the image abbreviation. And I'll put a view word wrap here. You'll have to work hard to see it. You can see that the word wrap is closed. So, what will happen here is that the horizontal scroll bar won't come. Now, what I'll do is I'll write images here. First of all, I'll write images here. And I'll simply bring an image here. Now, you can bring an image from the internet. I'll write here, let's say we want to bring an image. Train key. Train key images. Because we've run a lot of train in this course. So, we'll bring train images. Why will we bring any other image? I'll save images. And here in sigma web development course, in the folder number 5, there's a CMS file. In fact, I'll do one thing. I'll cancel it. I'll take its SNP because it's a CMS extension. I'll go to PNG and take it. So, I've pressed Windows, Shift and S. It's a shortcut to snipping tool. If you don't know, then now you'll know through sigma web development course that if you press Windows, Shift and S, your snipping tool opens. If you don't know this, then tell me in the comments section. Now, what we'll do here is, I've done Windows, Shift and S. And I got into the conversation. So, you click here and save it. Here, the floppy disk option of save, you click here. And in downloads, in sigma web development course, we'll save it in video file. We've saved it in the name of image. Now, in HTML, there's an IMG tag. As soon as you put IMG, both SRC and ALT are its required attributes. In fact, you can also not write ALT, but it's recommended. I'll tell you what happens with these attributes. First of all, if you write in SRC, image.png. You can see this image here. And I'll put train image in ALT. Okay? Now, if I show you this in the browser, previewing, then you can see this. This is our page and this is the train image. What happened by doing this? Where did the ALT go? You can say, I'll tell you where it went. So, the thing we put in ALT, we didn't see it now. Let's say, for some reason, the server doesn't show you the image. What will happen then? Let's say I wrote image2 by mistake. Now, there's no file named image2.png. What will be the error? What will happen? I'll show you what will happen. So, ALT will be displayed here. And this kind of an error image will be displayed. Which will tell you that the image you've put, put it properly, you've done something wrong. Or the server URL you've given, there's no image there. These things are displayed like this. And ALT is displayed there. So, the user gets to know what's the purpose of this image. And if I come back here, you can put ALT in the image like this. If I don't put ALT, what will happen? If I don't put ALT, the ALT text won't show up. So, you won't want the user to see this image when your server error comes up. You'll want it to be like this. The user will see it like this. It's written in train image. You'll see it like this. I hope you understood this. So, the image is straightforward. There are two more attributes of it. Which are very important. One is width. Which is width in pixels. If I set it to 23, width is equal to, you can see. In fact, I'll fix the image first. I've written image2 by mistake. It's image.png. So, you can see here. I've taken 23 pixels. Which is very small. So, I'll make it 230 pixels. You don't need to write PX in this. When we write width in CSS, we'll see that we need to write PX. Or we just write width equal to double quotes in the number. As you can see. Okay. So, if I bring it here, you can see that we've seen this small image. If I give it the height, I'll give it the height. I'll give it the height as well. I'll say that if I keep its height 230, then its aspect ratio will also be reduced. So, it'll get a little stretched. Because it has made its width 230 and its height 230 as you can see. Now, if you want its height to be 230 and its width to be automatically adjusted, then you just use height attribute. Now, remove the width one here. So, its height will be 230 pixels. And it'll go as far as it can go in width. It'll automatically adjust. Now, look. It's automatically adjusted in width. And it took this in height. Now, what happens is that width and height can be adjusted through CSS. And we'll see in the CSS section why we should always set this width and height. We should always set one thing from width and height. Such that when our page is loading, then the image inside our page should not come out instantly. I'll tell you in the upcoming videos. But now you understand that these width and height attributes, I've heard that these are deprecated and should not be used now. But I say that they should be used for SEO purposes. Why should they be used? I'll tell you in the upcoming videos about core web vitals and SEO. For now, you can assume that width gives image to width, height gives image to height. If one of them is set, then the other one automatically sets. And these values are in pixels. And you don't have to write PX or pixel. You just have to write this number. And that's it. This is an attribute, height. And it's an SRC attribute, an alt attribute. You can also use style attribute in this. In fact, you can use style attribute with almost all tags. So, this was about image. Now, we'll talk about tables in HTML. Table tags are very useful in HTML. I'll tell you what table tags are. You can see a table from table tags. Now, I'll copy this table from here. And when I copy this table from here, you can see my page will look like this. So, this is the table of HTML. Where is my preview page? Here it is. Here, you can see the name, HarryAge100. Now, if I put many other things here, suppose I put something like this. Suppose I put name. And here I put, let us say, Harry's designation. Suppose I put programmer. And let us say, I want to put more things. I'll use alt shift bottom arrow key. I'll use alt shift bottom arrow key. And here, let us say, I want to write favorite language. And I want to write, suppose, JavaScript. And now, you can see that this table will look like this. Name, destination, favorite language. So, what is this? How does it work? I'll tell you. Let us say, we used table tag. Table tag has tr tag, which is table row. What will come in this row? You'll get to see this. Now, if you want to use this as table heading, you'll say, this is my table row. This is my row. Name, destination, and your favorite language. What will come in this row? And what will be that? Here, you can see that it will be a heading. So, I'll use th. Th means table heading. And we'll write that only once. Once we put the heading, then we'll put the data. So, we'll put td in table row. Which stands for table data. And here, all the rows you put in tr, your rows will be added. So, here, let us say, I write Sam. And this is also a programmer. And this is Java, its favorite language. So, these rows will be added under the table. You can see that these rows are added. We'll see from CSS how it can be bordered. But it looks like default. And yes, I know it's ugly. But you just understand that the table works like this. Now, there are row span and call span attributes. Now, you see here, row span means how many rows your td will span. For example, let us say, I write here, I want Sam and programmer. Earlier, they were taking one cell. Sam was taking one cell, programmer was taking another cell. I want to write Sam in two cells. So, I don't want to write programmer, I want to write here, call span is equal to 2. So, call span is equal to 2 means, Sam will now take two columns instead. What does it mean? Sam will now take two columns instead. So, Sam will look like this. Let me show you. So, it took this whole column instead. So, call span means how many columns will be surrounded. By default, one cell will be surrounded by one cell. But sometimes, one cell will be surrounded by two columns. To demonstrate this, I'll explain it to you in Excel. In Excel, you can understand that this is a table of our HTML. Sometimes, I want to span two columns with one data. So, here we use merge cell. And here, let's say, I write Sam. In HTML, this is done by using call span. Sometimes, we want to merge vertically. Let's say, I want to merge these two cells. There, we use row span. And with whom we'll use row span? We'll use row span with td, obviously. So, with td, we'll use call span and row span. So, we'll use row span and it'll span like this. For two rows. So, I hope you understood this. And when we'll make tables of HTML, you'll understand it better. But let me show you row span quickly. So, if I write row span as equal to 2 and then I write another tr here, you'll see that this is how my table looks like. Now, to better explain this, I'll add a CSS style here. I'll add a style sheet here. And I'll name this style sheet as style.css. So, style.css. And you don't need to understand CSS. I'll tell you already. I'll write border in td. 2px solid black. And I'll tell you how it works. But for now, you'll understand that I've added this to explain it to you. So, I said that this row will have Harry, programmer and JavaScript. Then I said that this Sam, how much will be its row span? I gave 2 rowspan. First, I said that my Java will have 2 rowspan. So, how many rows will Java take? Obviously, 2 rowspan. So, Java will take 2 rows. So, you can see that Java took 2 rows. So, when Java took 2 rows, it means I don't have to write Java in the next one because its row is already surrounded. So, I'll not write Java in the next one. So, I'll not write Java here. I've added 2 rowspan for this. So, what happened by doing this? You can see that it was Harry, programmer and JavaScript. Then I said that this Sam will take 2 columns. This Sam will take 2 columns. And this Java will take 2 rows. So, you can see that exactly what happened. It took 2 rows and 2 columns. So, this is how you can use row span and call span in HTML. In HTML table, we can add captions. And to add captions, we can use this type of caption. So, I'll show you that if we use caption in table student details or employee details, then your page will look like this. You can see that employee details caption will be added here. Now, we can change its font size by using CSS. But for now, by default, it looks like this. You can also add header and footer. You can add Thead and Tfoot. You can add header and footer. For example, if I add some content in Thead and Tfoot, like this, if I add header and footer, then you can see Thead and Tfoot. You can see that header and footer are added here. Now, I'll tell you about another tag which is called brtag which adds line break. So, you can see that everything is down. So, this is header. And I'll add footer down here. I won't add it here. I'll add it after my table. So, this is my table footer. Now, I can change it by using CSS. Now, I can group my header and footer with Thead and Tfoot like this. So, what will be the header of my table? I can group this as TH. I can add it in Thead. Along with that, the content in the table will be in the Tbody. So, what will be in the Tbody? I'll get the content of my table like this. And after this, if I write Tfoot here and I want to add some data at the end, then I'll add another TR. As you can see, I'll right-click it and document the format. So, it'll be a better format. Suppose, I want to add this kind of TR and I'll group it. So, I've added it in Tfoot, some TRs, I've added it in Tbody, and I've added it in Thead, which is my table header. Obviously, there won't be any change. I've only grouped it. I'll write footer here so that you can see that it's a footer. I'll write foot here. And you can see that our last row is foot. Now, what's the benefit of doing this? We've only grouped it so that we can target it from CSS. But you can group it like this. Your whole table will have head content and foot content here. And body content comes in between head and foot. But you can write it here. But ideally, head, body, and then foot. I hope you understood this. So, that's all about HTML tables. You don't need to know more than this. And now, we'll talk about the list. List is very important in HTML because we'll use it a lot. There are different types of lists in HTML. One is ordered list, one is unordered list, and one is definition list. Unordered and ordered list are the most used. Let's see unordered list first. Whenever we want to have unordered data, like I'll write here UL. So, I'll write here UL means unordered list. I can write Li in it. I can write Harry. And then I can write Rohan. And then I can write Shubham. So, when I write Harry, Rohan, Shubham, I'll write UL like this. This is unordered list. Harry, Rohan, Shubham is here. They don't have any order. But if I want it to be ordered, I can write it with the help of OL. If I make its opening, closing tag OL and keep the other things the same, then it will be ordered list. So, here it will have 1, 2, 3. You can do ABC with this 1, 2, 3. You can do capital ABC. You can do Roman numbers with the help of CSS. You can do this with the help of CSS. You can see here that I wrote Li in UL. You can see here that I wrote Li in OL. So, it's 1, 2, 3. It's an example of ordered list. And it's an example of definition list. Definition list is rarely used. It's preview is like this. I've added heading first. Then I've written DL. DL means definition list. Then DT and then DD. So, here definition term is there. So, it's like this. You can change CSS. It's rarely used. But you should know about it for interviews. If you ask about definition list, then it's previewed like this. I'm not showing it for the sake of time. But try it out. Here, we'll see the unordered list. I've told you about unordered list. It's simple and straightforward. You can customize its bullet points by using type attribute. Let's write type is equal to square. I'll write type is equal to square. Let's say I write square. So, I've written type is equal to square in the unordered list. It's like a square. Similarly, I can circle its type in the unordered list. I can square it. I can disc it. Disc is by default. I can square it. I can circle it. Along with that, you can add many other list items in the unordered list. Now, let's see the unordered list in a little more detail. In the unordered list, you can write li as 1, 2, 3. But you can use type is equal to i. When you use type is equal to i, you'll get upper case roman numbers. When you use type is equal to i, you'll get lower case roman numbers. Type is equal to 1 is default. You don't need to do this. If you use small a, you'll get alphabetical. If you use capital a, you'll get upper case alphabetical. Type is equal to i. VS Code is giving us examples and suggestions. It's easier for us to see its possible values. It's easier for us to see its possible values. VS Code is very useful. Many people are using old editors which were used long ago. If you know their plugins, you can switch to VS Code Modern. All the big developers use VS Code. You'll see it using VS Code. If you want to code on your phone, I recommend Replet. I want to give a shout out to Replet.com. I use it a lot. I think it's very useful. You can use Replet.com on your phone. If you don't have a computer, you can use it. You'll get templates in it. I'll cover it in the upcoming videos. I'll stick to VS Code. I hope you understood the ordered list, unordered list, definition list. We've completed 5 videos in the SIGMAP development series. I want you to comment in the first video about your thoughts on the codes. I'll get the stars from the stars. You can see the initial review of the codes according to the 5 videos. I know that I'm late in ordering but I don't see people commenting on YouTube like this. But I still want you to comment and tell me how the codes are going. I want you to comment in the first video. Keep writing SIGMAPACHOP in the comments. It gives me a lot of motivation. This way, we'll have a two-way interaction. I'll be happy if you keep commenting. I like the two-way interaction. I'll give you the link to the video. This is the playlist. Like the video. Comment SIGMAPACHOP in the comments. And name your village. Thank you so much for watching this video. I'll see you next time. Bye!"
