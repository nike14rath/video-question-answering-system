The concept of IDN classes is one of the most confusing concepts. In fact, when I was learning HTML in my early days, I used to get confused in IDN classes. ID means unique identifier. That means if you give an ID to an element, then you will not give that ID to the other element. But class means that if you want to give multiple elements, then you will give it multiple classes. For example, you can give a class named red to a div and a form. Similarly, you can give a class named BG red to an article tag and a header tag. Do like this video because we will now go to the computer screen and see these things very closely. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, I have come back. If you haven't accessed the sigma web development codes, then you can access the playlist by clicking on the bookmark. Click on save and the source code is also being uploaded to github. Now I will come to the folder and create a folder named video9. So I will create a folder named video9. I will type video9 and after that I will right click on shift and open with code. And you can see that it has opened in BS code. Now I will type index.html and I will enter it with an exclamation mark. And I will tell you guys what ID and classes are. Do you have an Aadhaar card? If you don't have it, then you must have some ID. Now don't write in the comments that you don't have ID. Whenever you go somewhere, you have to show ID to prove your identity. That I am this. Now if you want to understand about ID and classes in HTML, then ID is your identity. Okay. What is that? It's your identity. So listen to a story here. This is John and this is Harry. Okay. These two are very good friends. They don't share their lunch and they are very good friends. They are not in terms of food and they are friends in other things. Now you can see that John and Harry have their own Aadhaar card ID. So this is my Aadhaar number and John's Aadhaar number looks something like this. Okay. So this is John's Aadhaar number and this is my Aadhaar number. Our Aadhaar numbers can never be the same. Or if you consider that our friend is Tanya and John's friend is Shruti. Okay. So their Aadhaar numbers will be different. And this is Tanya's Aadhaar number. This is Tanya's Aadhaar number. Now this Aadhaar number will be different for everyone. So John and Harry were friends and John's friend is Shruti. So this is Tanya's Aadhaar number. None of these four numbers is the same. If I tell you any of these Aadhaar numbers, then you will understand that it's Harry's Aadhaar number. And if I tell you that it's Shruti's Aadhaar number. And if I tell you that it's Tanya's Aadhaar number. So this Aadhaar number will uniquely identify Tanya, Harry, Shruti and John. So this is their Aadhaar number. This is their ID. No one else will get this Aadhaar number. Okay. Along with that, Let's say that John and Harry spent their childhood together. They were both tall and used to study in the same class. And the name of that class was class 10. Okay. Let's say they are in the 10th class. Okay. Let's say. It's said to be accepted. And let's say Shruti is in the 9th class. And Tanya is also in the 9th class. Okay. So both of them are in the 9th class. Okay. Tanya is also in the 9th class. And Shruti is also in the 9th class. So what is Shruti's class? It's in the 9th class. Tanya's class can also be in the 9th class. Shruti won't study alone in this class. Or Harry won't study alone in the 10th class. There are other kids in the class. So the meaning of class is that In one class, Harry and John are there. So can a person's class be multiple? A person's class can be multiple. Let's say that Harry's class is in the 10th class. And he goes to a tuition. And he goes to a class in 10A. Let's say that there are classes in the tuition. So it can be multiple classes. One is in the 10th class. And the other is in the 10A. And Harry wears a red t-shirt. So his class is also in the red class. Okay. So class doesn't mean that he's going to study. Class means that he's classified in this class. Let's say that. Now let's leave John and Harry Shruti. Okay. Let me delete this. Let me zoom out and delete it. Okay. There's no point in doing this. Now let's move to index.htm. Let's say that I've made a div. Okay. And I've given it a class, red. Okay. And I've made a span. And I've given it a class, red. Okay. Can I give different elements to the classes I've given? Or can I give the same class? Yes, I can. But if I want to put an id in any element. Let's say that I've put an id in its first div. I can put anything in the id. So I can't give this id to any other element. Because this is its Aadhar card. Even if it's a second div, I can't put it. Even then I'll have to put something else in the id. Okay. I've put the id in the second div. Okay. And I'll write second here. And I'll write first here. Okay. So this is the concept of id and classes. I personally realized this very late. When I was learning Blueloft in my early days. No one told me that id only identifies one element. And the class can put multiple classes in one element. And can put only one class in multiple elements. Do you understand? For example, if I gave it a red class. I can also give it a BG yellow class. Okay. BG yellow. I can only give it one class. And if we give multiple classes to any element. Then we can put space in it. For example, if I want multiple classes to be put in this element. Then what will I do? First I'll write red here. Then I'll put space and write BG yellow. So I can give multiple classes to the same element. Can I give multiple id to the same element? Have you ever heard of two Aadhar cards of someone? I don't know if someone has made it from here and there. But there are no Aadhar cards. Aadhar number is one of one person. And Aadhar number cannot be the same for different people. Okay. One person cannot have multiple cards. Different people cannot have the same number. But the class. If I ask you which color of t-shirt you wear. Or you can wear a red colored t-shirt. No problem. You'll get it if you go to the street. And you'll get people who like mango, banana or grapes. So let's say they are in banana class. Or they are in grapes class. Okay. In mango class. So we can classify in one class. And we can give different elements to the same class. So I hope you understood this. Now I'll write some CSS here. And don't say that you are not studying CSS. What I'm writing in CSS is. I'm writing some alien language. Okay. Inside style.css. But I'm trying to make a point. I'll click here. And the preview is showing like this. First or second. I'll show you one thing. I'll show you how to target a class in CSS. By using dot. Dot red means red class. And hash first div means. Hash means ID and dot means class. Okay. If I say that the first div. Color it's background red. Okay. So if you color the background of the first div. It will get red. Okay. These are selectors in CSS. And I don't want to confuse you. And I can comment like this in CSS. Okay. But we'll read all these things later. Now by using dot red. I'll write here background color red. And what I'll do in dot bg yellow. I'll put dot. Dot means class. It means class bg yellow. And I'll make the background color yellow. Sorry. I'll make it color red. I won't make the background color red. Dot red means color gets red. Look. It's color gets red. And background color gets yellow. So you can use IDN classes in CSS like this. I hope you understood this. Now one thing to note here is very important. IDN classes are attributes of an element. This is ID attribute. And this is class attribute. So if I ask what are ID classes? Are they elements? No. They are attributes of elements. Now there's one more use of ID. I'll tell you what's the use of ID. If I take you to Wikipedia and write coding. So this page of Wikipedia. Suppose I go to some other page. On a big page. So you see that when you go to any page on Wikipedia. So what you can do is. That you can take the link of that particular place. I'll show you how it happens. I'll go to some other page. I'll scroll down. And here I'll inspect. I'll see its ID. This is its ID. Okay. So I'll copy its ID. Okay. And if I put here hashtag. And this ID. Now I'll hit enter. So it'll bring me here directly. In ICD-8. So if I put it in incognito. It'll scroll and show me that particular ID. Look. It scrolled and instead of showing me this. It scrolled and showed me. Because it wants to bring me to this ID. So it works in linking too. So this is the ID. Okay. Remember this too. Very few people will tell you. That you can generate links too. If you come to any link. You'll write the ID by using hashtag. So when you open that link. It'll focus the same ID. Like it's giving me in this case. You can see that as I'm hitting enter. So I might have done the wrong ID here. But you got the point. You got the point. It's 29.29. And I'll hit enter. So you see I'm down. If I open incognito or reload it. So you see I'm down. If I scroll it up. And after this. I'll open a new tab. And. If I do this. It's bringing me to the page. Which page this ID is on. So I hope you got the idea and the classes. Through this video. ID means like Aadhar Card. Class means. One person's property. Like he likes red. Or which class he's in. One element can be given multiple classes. One element can be red. Its background can be yellow. And the other element too. Its color can be red. And background can be yellow. So red class can be given multiple elements. If you want the red class. Just put it on one element. And you can put red class in one element. Or you can put BGLO class too. So I hope you got it. So that's it for this video guys. I was reading captions. And I laughed reading captions. So I told them to name my name in the village. And I laughed 5-10 times after hearing this. It's very fast. I told them to access it. Name your village and my name. So on this note. Access the playlist. Access the github too. Like the video. Write in the comment section. Hashtag sigma batch op. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time."}
